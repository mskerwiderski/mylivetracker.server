Dear ${firstname},<br>
<br>
I have created an account for you:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portal:</span>
http://portal.mylivetracker.de<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Your username:</span> ${username}<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Your password:</span> ${password}<br>
<br>
Please change your password in the settings. It would be nice too, if
you check and update your master data such as name, address and email
address, if needed.<br>
<br>
There are two more things to do before you can start with the live
tracking:<br>
<ul>
<li>Your tracking device must be registered in the MyLiveTracker
settings as a sender, so that the incoming position data of your
tracking device can be automatically assigned to your account.</li>
<li>The tracking device itself must be configured with the server
data of the MyLiveTracker platform.<br>
</li>
</ul>
For this: Please register to our <a
href="http://forum.mylivetracker.info" target="_blank">MyLiveTracker-Forum</a>.
There you will find a lot of information about the portal itself -
among others the <a
href="http://forum.mylivetracker.info/viewforum.php?f=5"
target="_blank">configuration instructions</a> for the most popular
tracking devices and the <a
href="http://forum.mylivetracker.info/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=67"
target="_blank">server connect information</a>.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, or not immediately get along, don’t hesitate
to contact us in the forum. We are also glad about any feedback, such
as suggestions for improvements or error messages.<br>
<br>
Two more things:<br>
<ul>
<li>MyLiveTracker is a privately run, non-profit project, which is
funded exclusively by donations. So feel free, if you like to support
the further development of MyLiveTracker via a PayPal donation.</li>
<li>If you use the MyLiveTracker Android App, we would be also happy
about every positive review.<br>
</li>
</ul>
Kind regards,<br>
<br>
Your MyLiveTracker Team<br>
